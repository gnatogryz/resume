# Profile
I am a software engineer with years of experience spanning multiple technologies and applications.
Starting with game development, then branching off to fit the ever-evolving profile of the company, eventually reaching **web technologies**.

I have served as lead developer for several **Unity3D** projects, filled the role of Product Owner when it was needed,
participated in choosing the right tech-stack for our projects, and much more.

I have extensive experience working with external teams (mostly **Hewlett-Packard** US branch),
coordinating work and making sure the management understands the developers' point of view.

Recently I took the position of manager / head developer for a front–end team within **Toolkit3D**, focused on application development, and contributions to
a voxel engine based design software with a C♯ based user interface.

I focus on writing code _as short as possible_ and _as reusable as possible_, utilizing appropriate design patterns and language features.

# About me
Whenever possible, I opt to problem-solve instead of brute-forcing challenges.
I am open to learning new technologies if need be, and when something piques my interest.

My current obsession is photography, especially wildlife and outdoors.
