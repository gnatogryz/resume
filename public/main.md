# Profile
I am a software engineer with years of experience spanning multiple technologies and applications.
Starting with game development, then branching off to fit the ever-evolving profile of the company, eventually reaching web technologies.

I have served as lead developer for several Unity3D projects, filled the role of Product Owner when it was needed,
